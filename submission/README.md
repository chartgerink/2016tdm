# Submission

The submission folder is destined to streamline your submission process and prevent the accumulation of manuscript versions. A proposed structure is as follows:

1. Provide a working version of the manuscript in this folder
2. Upon submission, include a folder called `round 1 submission` with all the files submitted (including the manuscript)
3. Upon receiving the reviews, include a folder called `round 1 review` with all the reviews and a potential response to the reviewers
4. Keep doing this for each subsequent submission and review round.
5. You can include details in each submission folder as to where it is submitted.
