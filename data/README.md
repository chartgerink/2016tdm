# Data

The data folder is the folder that is destined to contain all the data. Some good practices are outlined below:

1. The very first raw datafile should *never* be deleted or edited. Make this file read-only to ensure this will not happen (on windows: right click -> properties -> tick "Read only" box; on mac: right click -> get info -> at the bottom, change to "Read only")
2. Ensure that the data are accompanied by an appropriate codebook, if the datafile is not self-explanatory to an outsider.
3. Ensure that the data is available to at least one co-author and that you have a back-up, to ensure data preservation
