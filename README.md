# Transparent project management template

This project includes a folder structure to manage your research project. Each folder contains a readme file which provides a general idea of what to include. The `contributions.csv` file can be used to specify contributions in the research project. Note that this template is geared towards empirical projects.

Additionally, not all projects require all parts of this template. The template is meant as a pruning template, where it is duplicated and subsequently adjusted to one's own needs. It is merely here to provide a framework to build on.
